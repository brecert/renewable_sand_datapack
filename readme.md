# Renewable Sand
> makes sand renewable by adding a new mechanic to create sand

Why?
- sand currently isn't a renewable resource
- because of sands use in redstone, crafting recipes, tnt, and more there should be a renewable way to get sand other than destroying deserts and natural terrain

Goals
- sand should be renewable
- the process should be automatable in some way
- the process should contain boundries to be overcome if it is to be automated
- the mechanic should feel vanillaish as possible
